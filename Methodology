INTRODUCTION.
There are 3 tools we will employ in this project to identify, written or typed text in images. These tools are OpenCV, tesseract and TensorFlow. The techniques we will use will not only be able to identify text characters from scanned pictures and images but also from videos in real-time.
So, in each frame of our image, our object recognition model will identify all text characters in the frame and draw a box around them, then we use the coordinates of these boxes to extract our region of interest as a smaller image that contains only the object with the text. These images will be enhanced with filters from OpenCV. These smaller images will then be passed to PyTesseract which will provide us with the text that has been read in the form of a python string. For training we will be using CPU on a virtual desktop.
